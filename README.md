# COVID-19-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Objective
In this project, COVID-19 Confirmed Cases and Fatalities were analyzed all over the world. 
Visualization were created using plotly to understand the impact of the pandemic around the world

Motivation
COVID-19 has been wreaking havoc on the world. Few countries have been successful in keeping the fatalities and cases under control.
Flattening the curve was being the goal throughout. I wanted to confirm if lockdown and self-isolation were indeed working. I wrote a blog on medium explaining my findings : https://medium.com/@divyabudale/coronavirus-why-social-distancing-is-necessary-e61d9c91e1c7

Data - The dataset included cases starting on Jan 22 2020 to May 15 2020 containing 35995 rows for 184 countries.
