# COVID-19-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Objective : In this project, COVID-19 Confirmed Cases and Fatalities were analyzed all over the world. 
Visualization were created using plotly to understand the impact of the pandemic around the world

Motivation : COVID-19 has been wreaking havoc on the world. Few countries have been successful in keeping the fatalities and cases under control. Flattening the curve was being the goal throughout. I wanted to confirm if lockdown and self-isolation were indeed working. I wrote a blog on medium explaining my findings : https://medium.com/@divyabudale/coronavirus-why-social-distancing-is-necessary-e61d9c91e1c7

Data : The dataset included cases starting on Jan 22 2020 to May 15 2020 containing 35995 rows for 184 countries. 

Analysis : Exploratory data analysis and visualization has been created using plotly

Results : Social Distancing and Lockdown resulted in virus slowing down in Italy and Spain. US has become the country with highest number of confirmed cases totaling more than 400k whereas the number of cases in China where the initial outbreak started now looks pale in comparison to Italy, Spain, Germany and France.
